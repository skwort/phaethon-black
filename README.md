# PHAETHON-BLACK: ADS-B Aircraft Transponder Tracking


## Brief
This project aims to create a system that can track and display ADS-B transponders of nearby aircraft within a designated portion of the sky. By harnessing the capabilities of Software Defined Radio (SDR) and embedded systems, the goal is to provide real-time transponder data including aircraft IDs and other relevant detail.

See Wiki page for comprehensive documentation.
